# Ridge Regression

* Penalizing ```features``` which has higher slope

* ```Least squares + lambda * (slope)^2```
> lambda always ranges from 0 
> Value selected by using cross validation
* It leads to high bias but low variance.

* If slope value is huge we need to penalize with help of ```ridge``` to make the slope less steeper.
