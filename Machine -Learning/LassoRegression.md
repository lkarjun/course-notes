# Lasso Regression

> Least abs shrinkage

* Lasso Regression just not overcoming the overfitting senario but also helps to do feature selection.

* ```Least squares + lambda * | slope |```
> magnitude of slope.

> Takes absolute value.

> can exclude useless varible from equations.

* the difference between ```Ridge``` and ```Lasso``` is that ridge can only shrink the slope asymptotically close to 0 while Lass can shrink the slope all the way to 0.

> helps in resolving multicolinearity.

> The hybrit ```Elastic-Net Regression``` is especially good at dealing with situation when there are correlations between parameter / features.
