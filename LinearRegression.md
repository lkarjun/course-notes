# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear model.

## Assumtion
---
Model that assumes a `Linear Relationship` between the input independent  variables (x) and the single output dependent  variable (y). <br />

## Best fit line
* Y = mx + c
  * m = Slope
  * c = Intercept
  > when variable x is zero `Y = c` eg: Your income is always constant even if you don't have any job.
---

## Cost Function
* Cost function = 1/2m summarion of 1 to m (Y-Yi) ^ 2
* We need to minimize the error cost function to find the best fit line.
