# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear model.

## Assumtion
---
Model that assumes a `Linear Relationship` between the input independent  variables (x) and the single output dependent  variable (y). <br />

## Best fit line
* Y = mx + c
  * m = Slope
  * c = Intercept
  > when variable x is zero `Y = c` eg: Your income is always constant even if you don't have any job.

* We need to minimize the error `(Y - Yi)^2`
* Cost function = 1/2m summation of 1 to m (Y - Yi) ^ 2
