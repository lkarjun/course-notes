## Lesson 1

* Label 
> The data that we're trying to predict
* Architecture
> The template of the model that we're trying to fit; i.e, the actual mathematical function that we're passing the input data and parameters to
* Model 
> the combination of the architecture with a particular set of parameters
* Parameters 
> The values in the model that change what task it can do and that are updated through model training
* Fit
> Update the parameters of the model such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the target labels
* Train
> A synonym for fit.
* pretrined model
> A model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset, and will be fine-tuned
* Fine-tune
>Update a pretrained model for a different task

* Epoch
> One complete pass through the input data
* Loss 
> A measure of how good the model is.
* Metric
> A measurement of how good the model is using the validation set.
* Validation set
> A set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is.
* Overfitting
> Training a model in such a way that it remembers specific feautres of the input data, rather than generalizing well to data not seen during training.
*Cnn
>Convolutional neural network:
a type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision tasks
